# Siew Ling's Personal Portfolio

Hi! I'm Siew Ling.

As a software tester for the past 10 years, I specialized in exploratory testing and user acceptance testing. By working with developers and business teams to design test plans and test cases according to business requirements, I get an overview of how technology meets the different business operations needs.

Inspired by the wonders of technology, I attended a 3 month bootcamp in Software Engineering to upgrade my technical skill set. In 3 months, I built a total of 4 projects!
